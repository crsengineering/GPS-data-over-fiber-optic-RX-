Receiver unit for GPS data (NMEA+PPS) over fiber optic


Many seismic digitizers use GPS data (NMEA sentences and PPS signal) to synchronize seismic data acquired.
Usually GPS antenna is placed few meters away from digitizer (with integrated GPS receiver) but sometimes we have to inatall seismic instruments inside caves and GPS antenna cable becomes a big problem.
We can use long "low-loss" RF cables but sometimes is not so easy.
Some digitizers (such some Kinemetrics or Guralp models) have an additional connector for external GPS unit where we can send NMEA data through RS-232 or RS-485 protocol.
 or much more easy install fiber optic cable or use preexisting one.
